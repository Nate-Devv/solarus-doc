\tableofcontents

%Stairs make fancy animations, movements and sounds when the
\ref lua_api_hero "hero" takes them.

This type of \ref lua_api_entity "map entity" can be declared in the
\ref lua_api_map_overview_files "map data file".
It can also be created dynamically with
\ref lua_api_map_create_stairs "map:create_stairs()".

\section lua_api_stairs_overview Overview

%Stairs are here to provide class transitions between two
\ref lua_api_map "maps" or two 
\ref lua_api_map_overview_position "layers" on the same map,
linked by
\ref lua_api_tile "tiles" that look like stairs.

They don't provide any fundamental feature: you can already use
\ref lua_api_teletransporter "teletransporters"
and
\ref lua_api_destination "destinations"
to make the \ref lua_api_hero "hero" go from a map to another one.
And you can use
\ref lua_api_sensor "sensors"
to make him go from a layer to another on the same map.
But they add fanciness to these transitions:
the sound of climbing or going down stairs,
a special movement and appropriate sprite animations.

For stairs that transport the hero to a different
\ref lua_api_map "map",
you still have to use a
\ref lua_api_teletransporter "teletransporter"
and a
\ref lua_api_destination "destination".
Indeed, the stairs are additional, they don't replace teletransporters and
destinations.
You just have put all three entities
(the stairs, a teletransporter and a destination) at the same coordinates
and it works.

Stairs that move from a layer to another layer
inside the same map work differently.
They change this layer automatically for the hero.
They must be placed on the lowest one of those two layers.

%Stairs are invisible: you are supposed to place appropriate tiles where you
make stairs. Their size is always 16x16 pixels.

\section lua_api_stairs_inherited_methods Methods inherited from map entity

Stairs are particular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all methods from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_methods to know these methods.

\section lua_api_stairs_methods Methods of the type stairs

None.

\section lua_api_stairs_inherited_events Events inherited from map entity

Events are callback methods automatically called by the engine if you define
them.

Stairs are particular \ref lua_api_entity "map entities".
Therefore, they inherit all events from the type map entity.

See \ref lua_api_entity_events to know these events.

\section lua_api_stairs_events Events of the type stairs

None.
